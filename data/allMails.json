It is my understanding that the RMV has the capability of cross-referencing images with the RMVdatabase of photos in order to help law enforcement agencies identify unknown suspects. We havea case out of   in which we have surveillance images of a suspect but no identification,and we were hoping to make use of this facial recognition software if possible. I have attached several stills from the surveillance image to this email. Can you please tell me if youare able to run facial recognition and, if so, whether or not these photos will suffice for this purpose? Thank you very much. If you have any questions or concerns, or need any clarification, please feelfree to let me know.

I looked at the   and immediately knew they were fake since the license number on somestarted with other letters than S, and also had too many numbers.  I ran the names DOB and gotnothing in CJIS and III. I was hoping to run FR on all of the attached licenses and see if we can get any hits back. ICE is working a theory this is a ID fraud case.

This license hasbeen expired since 9-25-2002. The image in CJIS is the only one we have on file. In my professional opinion, given the varying aging effect of a   male, I believe the facialbiometrics in the given pictures present enough of a resemblance that a reasonable person wouldbelieve the persons depicted may be one in the same and therefore further investigation iswarranted.

This license hasbeen expired since 9-25-2002. The image in CJIS is the only one we have on file. In my professional opinion, given the varying aging effect of a   male, I believe the facialbiometrics in the given pictures present enough of a resemblance that a reasonable person wouldbelieve the persons depicted may be one in the same and therefore further investigation iswarranted. *Disclaimer: The result of a face recognition search is provided by the FIU only as an investigativelead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT.

He is no longer under supervision but we have a ton of his previous identities.  His casewas prosecuted in the District of NH and we did supervision for them.  Interesting case though, he wascharged with new offenses while on supervision and the state dismissed those charges and he was alsothe victim of an armed home invasion in Fitchburg.  See identifiers and docs below....  Also, the AUSA inNH thought he was   of the D.R., brother of previously deported  .  He alsoallegedly had a minor son (about age 7 in 2010) named  , with a  .

If you could try the 3 attached photo's we are lookingfor a possible identity in facial recognition prior to him altering his prints.     Sgt Planeta - He has a lengthy criminal record and driving record here in Mass. I'm guessinghe has a previous deportion out there that caused him to alter.     Gina - He has a previous Fed arrest around 2010.      Ashley - Can you try facial rec on your Passport side?      Chris and Carl, any input of the prints appreciated.Off.

    "body": "Subject: Fw: Francisco Gabriel Velez VegaAttachments: S4 .jpgPR License Front.jpgPR License Back.jpgPR RMW Result .pngGood Morning Lt. Boyle,Just passing this information along regarding a motor vehicle stop I had this past week, duringwhich time Fusion Center assisted me.  I was presented with a PR Driver's License and Social Security Card by the rear seat passengeridentified as   (DOB:  , SS# ).  A CJIS queryof the SS# revealed another party with the same name, DOB, and SS#.  A III query revealedtwo different FBI numbers.  At that point, I believed I had an \"Impostor\" situation.  I reachedout to the Fusion Center for assistance with facial recognition, who provided various OLNsbased upon the facial recognition hits.  These OLNS are listed below and reflect the sameparty using different names, DOBs, and SS#:I then received an email from PR Police Department, which matched the PR License holder Ihad on the stop.  Therefore, I kicked him loose, believing the passenger may have been thevictim of the Impostor, to which he no knowledge.  Attached in this email are the RMV photos from PR and MA, as well as the PR License thepassenger possessed.  Another flag that caught my eye was the PR License itself.  The licenseissue date was 03/21/2017.  I have a PDF Document from the Fraud Department in NYPD,which covers PR Licenses issued in 2019.  I noted a few indicators of a potentially forgedRMV document (missing gold star upper right hand corner, \"Not for Real ID Purposes\" was notomitted, \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" rather than \"Government of Puerto Rico\", and thelisted height and weight were typed without hyphens.  I'm not sure if the PR licenses issued in 2017 printed with different security measures, but itcame back valid from PR RMV.  I believe the passenger I had roadside was the victim basedupon the multiple OLNs used by the same party out of Lawrence, the passenger was able toanswer all roadside questions about Puerto Rico, and his finger prints were not mutilated.Please let know if you have any questions or need anything further.Respectfully,Tpr. Daniel Lawlor #4160Massachusetts State PoliceSP Charlton"

Both of these reports give detailed information such as phones, addresses, relatives, etc. that couldpotentially be useful to you. Within ISO, there was one insurance claim from September 2017 involving thesubject. That report is attached as well. The photo of your subject (the one you arrested) was also runthrough facial recognition.   has a DL history under that name/photo since at least around 2013 inMassachusetts. Searches of the subject within FBI and DEA systems were negative. Finally, I also reached out to my contact at DHS to take a look. I sent her all of the information and as soon asI get word from her, I will let you know. When I initially reached out to her she said “I ran the address and itcomes back to a   but I don’t have a DOB or anything else associated with that.” I sent her thephoto of the individual you stopped and she is going to try and run that through any facial rec systems theymay have.

If you could try the 3 attached photo's we are lookingfor a possible identity in facial recognition prior to him altering his prints.     Sgt Planeta - He has a lengthy criminal record and driving record here in Mass. I'm guessinghe has a previous deportion out there that caused him to alter.     Gina - He has a previous Fed arrest around 2010.      Ashley - Can you try facial rec on your Passport side?      Chris and Carl, any input of the prints appreciated.Off.

Interesting case though, he wascharged with new offenses while on supervision and the state dismissed those charges and he was alsothe victim of an armed home invasion in Fitchburg.  See identifiers and docs below....  Also, the AUSA inNH thought he was   of the D.R., brother of previously deported  .  He alsoallegedly had a minor son (about age 7 in 2010)  , with a  .

He had ahearing regarding this on August 1, 2017 and admitted same. The registry took administrative action(suspensions and fines) but he was not criminally charged. Those records have now been merged, soif you run the S  number in CJIS it will come back to the S  record. Is his true identity still in question?

This statement is being reviewed by the public safety commschain, MSP command, and RMV/DOT officials. Please send any comments backand I will review and synthesize any edits from the three groups. Dave ProcopioThe Massachusetts State Police utilize facial recognition technology, whenapplicable, to further criminal investigations, primarily our CommonwealthWatch Center as well as through our unit attached to the RMV. It is a valuabletool that can help investigators identify criminals and, by doing so, seek justicefor their victims and take offenders off the street before they commit anothercrime. The State Police unit at the RMV utilizes the technology to investigate suspectedlicense fraud. At the Watch Center, meanwhile, State Police analysts have thecapability to use facial recognition to help identify images of crime suspects at therequest of State Police units or other police agencies. Analysts can compareimages of unknown suspects against both the RMVdatabase and open-source social media.It is important to note that a facial recognition hit in and of itself is not a positiveidentification. Rather, it is an investigative lead that requires further follow up andvetting by case officers. This is part of the training our personnel receive, andwhen the Watch Center (part of our Fusion Center) performs a facial recognitionsearch for an outside agency, the following disclaimer is provided with theresults: The result of a face recognition search is provided by the CFC only as aninvestigative lead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVEIDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT. Any possible connection or involvementof any subject to the investigation must be determined through furtherinvestigation.As with any other investigative process or technology, use of facial recognitionsoftware may only be used for legitimate and clearly defined law enforcementpurposes, per MSP general investigative policies.Several recent examples of leads generated by MSP analysts through facialrecognition are below.Facial Recognition Examples:I-93 Public Safety Threat – Dirt Bike/ATV Operators• In February 2018, State Police Analysts assigned to the Commonwealth WatchCenter worked with Troopers out of the Cyber Crimes Unit to identify unknownparties involved in an incident that occurred on I-93 on Saturday, February 24,wherein more than twenty individuals created a traffic situation and public safetythreat by operating dirt bikes, ATVs, and other off-road vehicles on theexpressway. State Police made seven arrests on scene but many participantsremained unidentified. Utilizing open source investigative tools and FacialRecognition on videos and still photographs posted to social media from theevent, State Police Analysts were able to identify a number of additionalparticipants involved in the incident.Armed Robbery, Framingham, MA – Social Media IDs• In January, the Framingham Police Department requested assistance inidentifying four individuals believed to be involved in an armed robbery thatoccurred on January 14, 2019. Framingham PD was able to provide the webaddresses for social media profiles of the four suspects. Through a combination ofFacial Recognition and open source exploitation, State Police Analysts assignedto the Commonwealth Fusion Center were able to positively ID the suspects,despite several of them utilizing false names and not possessing MassachusettsLicenses or IDs. All four individuals have active warrants from various policedepartments, including several for other armed robberies.Road Rage Incident in Medford• In January, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by theMassachusetts State Police Medford Barracks regarding a road rage incident thatoccurred at Wellington Circle. The Trooper on scene provided cell phone video ofthe incident taken from inside the victim’s vehicle, depicting an unknown subjectapproaching and striking the vehicle. Facial Recognition conducted on a stillphotograph from the video returned a possible match to a Massachusetts Driver’sLicense or ID, which was providedwithin minutes to the investigator for follow-up.MSP Crime Gun Unit – Social Media IDs of Gang Members• In February, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contactedby theMassachusetts State Police Crime Gun Unit regarding an attempt to identify aseries of individuals on social media via Facial Recognition. The individuals,believed to be affiliated with a gang related crimes, were identified through acombination of Facial Recognition and open source exploitation of publiclyavailable information found on social media. In total, the identities ofapproximately 23 previously unidentified individuals were either confirmed viaphotograph/tattoo comparison, or tentatively identified via name, date of birth,and geographic profile combined with information publicly available on theirprofiles.Gang Identified for Out of State Agency• In March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by the the CriminalIntelligence Center from another eastern state regarding an attempt to identifyfour members of a street gang believed to have ties to Massachusetts throughpublicly accessible social media sources. Through a combination of FacialRecognition and open source investigation, all four suspects were positivelyidentified and their information shared with  State Police in the state from whichthe request originated pursuant to an ongoing investigation.MSP H-2 Identified Suspect with Felony Warrant(s)• Also in March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by theMassachusetts State Police Framingham Barracks regarding an attempt to identifyperson suspected of concealing his true identity from police. Facial Recognitionon a photograph taken by the investigating MSP Trooper on scene returned apossible match candidate. Subsequent investigation of the suspect corroboratedthe identification of Name/DOB, and also identified an existing felony warrantunder the suspect’s true name, resulting in the suspect’s arrest.

This statement is being reviewed by the public safety commschain, MSP command, and RMV/DOT officials. Please send any comments backand I will review and synthesize any edits from the three groups. Dave ProcopioThe Massachusetts State Police utilize facial recognition technology, whenapplicable, to further criminal investigations, primarily our CommonwealthWatch Center as well as through our unit attached to the RMV. It is a valuabletool that can help investigators identify criminals and, by doing so, seek justicefor their victims and take offenders off the street before they commit anothercrime. The State Police unit at the RMV utilizes the technology to investigate suspectedlicense fraud. At the Watch Center, meanwhile, State Police analysts have thecapability to use facial recognition to help identify images of crime suspects at therequest of State Police units or other police agencies. Analysts can compareimages of unknown suspects against both the RMVdatabase and open-source social media.It is important to note that a facial recognition hit in and of itself is not a positiveidentification. Rather, it is an investigative lead that requires further follow up andvetting by case officers. This is part of the training our personnel receive, andwhen the Watch Center (part of our Fusion Center) performs a facial recognitionsearch for an outside agency, the following disclaimer is provided with theresults: The result of a face recognition search is provided by the CFC only as aninvestigative lead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVEIDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT. Any possible connection or involvementof any subject to the investigation must be determined through furtherinvestigation.As with any other investigative process or technology, use of facial recognitionsoftware may only be used for legitimate and clearly defined law enforcementpurposes, per MSP general investigative policies.Several recent examples of leads generated by MSP analysts through facialrecognition are below.Facial Recognition Examples:I-93 Public Safety Threat – Dirt Bike/ATV Operators• In February 2018, State Police Analysts assigned to the Commonwealth WatchCenter worked with Troopers out of the Cyber Crimes Unit to identify unknownparties involved in an incident that occurred on I-93 on Saturday, February 24,wherein more than twenty individuals created a traffic situation and public safetythreat by operating dirt bikes, ATVs, and other off-road vehicles on theexpressway. State Police made seven arrests on scene but many participantsremained unidentified. Utilizing open source investigative tools and FacialRecognition on videos and still photographs posted to social media from theevent, State Police Analysts were able to identify a number of additionalparticipants involved in the incident.Armed Robbery, Framingham, MA – Social Media IDs• In January, the Framingham Police Department requested assistance inidentifying four individuals believed to be involved in an armed robbery thatoccurred on January 14, 2019. Framingham PD was able to provide the webaddresses for social media profiles of the four suspects. Through a combination ofFacial Recognition and open source exploitation, State Police Analysts assignedto the Commonwealth Fusion Center were able to positively ID the suspects,despite several of them utilizing false names and not possessing MassachusettsLicenses or IDs. All four individuals have active warrants from various policedepartments, including several for other armed robberies.Road Rage Incident in Medford• In January, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by theMassachusetts State Police Medford Barracks regarding a road rage incident thatoccurred at Wellington Circle. The Trooper on scene provided cell phone video ofthe incident taken from inside the victim’s vehicle, depicting an unknown subjectapproaching and striking the vehicle. Facial Recognition conducted on a stillphotograph from the video returned a possible match to a Massachusetts Driver’sLicense or ID, which was providedwithin minutes to the investigator for follow-up.MSP Crime Gun Unit – Social Media IDs of Gang Members• In February, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contactedby theMassachusetts State Police Crime Gun Unit regarding an attempt to identify aseries of individuals on social media via Facial Recognition. The individuals,believed to be affiliated with a gang related crimes, were identified through acombination of Facial Recognition and open source exploitation of publiclyavailable information found on social media. In total, the identities ofapproximately 23 previously unidentified individuals were either confirmed viaphotograph/tattoo comparison, or tentatively identified via name, date of birth,and geographic profile combined with information publicly available on theirprofiles.Gang Identified for Out of State Agency• In March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by the the CriminalIntelligence Center from another eastern state regarding an attempt to identifyfour members of a street gang believed to have ties to Massachusetts throughpublicly accessible social media sources. Through a combination of FacialRecognition and open source investigation, all four suspects were positivelyidentified and their information shared with  State Police in the state from whichthe request originated pursuant to an ongoing investigation.MSP H-2 Identified Suspect with Felony Warrant(s)• Also in March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by theMassachusetts State Police Framingham Barracks regarding an attempt to identifyperson suspected of concealing his true identity from police. Facial Recognitionon a photograph taken by the investigating MSP Trooper on scene returned apossible match candidate. Subsequent investigation of the suspect corroboratedthe identification of Name/DOB, and also identified an existing felony warrantunder the suspect’s true name, resulting in the suspect’s arrest.

    "body": "Subject: RE: deadline Friday—-HeraldFacial RecognitionHi—just trying to get all asks in one place, looks like 2 items for us. 1) Questions for RMV to answer – I drafted some responses below. Needs work!   I'm assuming the RMV makes these photos available to police if they ask for it? The1)RMV makes digitized images of credential holders available to law enforcement so lawenforcement may confirm the veracity of the credentials presented to them and theidentity of the individuals before them.Are there any steps the RMV takes to protect the privacy of individuals? Thedissemination of RMV held images is strictly controlled by the federal driver privacyprotection act. (As an example, the DPPA prohibits the RMV from releasing licenseimage photos to the media.)  Also, besides the RMV, does the DOT use facial recognition in any way? No. 2) Any RMV comments to Procopio statement. My suggestion/edits are highlighted. The Massachusetts State Police utilize (might change utilize to may access) facial recognitiontechnology, when applicable, to further criminal investigations, primarily our CommonwealthWatch Center as well as through our unit attached to the RMV. It is a valuable tool that canhelp investigators identify criminals and, by doing so, seek justice for their victims and takeoffenders off the street before they commit another crime. The State Police unit at the RMV utilizes the technology to investigate suspected driver’slicense and identity fraud. At the Watch Center, meanwhile, State Police analysts have thecapability to use facial recognition to help identify images of crime suspects at the request ofState Police units or other police agencies. Analysts can compare images of unknown suspectsagainst both the RMV database and open-source social media.It is important to note that a facial recognition hit (suggest changing to hit to potential match,not hit) in and of itself is not a positive identification. Rather, it is an investigative lead thatrequires further follow up and vetting by case officers. This is part of the training ourpersonnel receive, and when the Watch Center (part of our Fusion Center) performs a facialrecognition search for an outside agency, the following disclaimer is provided with theresults: The result of a face recognition search is provided by the CFC only as an investigativelead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT.Any possible connection or involvement of any subject to the investigation must be determinedthrough further investigation.As with any other investigative process or technology, use of facial recognition software mayonly be used for legitimate and clearly defined law enforcement purposes, per MSP generalinvestigative policies.

Boston Herald needs comment by noon. Thanks,Jacque DRAFT at 9:45 a.m. Questions for RMV to answer: Q: I'm assuming the RMV makes these photos available to police if they ask for it?The RMV makes digitized images of credential holders available to law enforcement solaw enforcement may confirm the veracity of the credentials presented to them.Q: Are there any steps the RMV takes to protect the privacy of individuals? Thedissemination of RMV held images is strictly controlled by the federal driver privacyprotection act. (As an example, the DPPA prohibits the RMV from releasing licenseimage photos to the media.)  Q: Also, besides the RMV, does the DOT use facial recognition in any way?MassDOT does not use facial recognition beyond the Registry’s use which is strictlycontrolled by the federal driver privacy protection act and policy guidelines. 2) Any RMV comments to David Procopio statement?. RMV suggested edits in yellow highlights. The Massachusetts State Police utilize (might change utilize to may access) facial recognitiontechnology, when applicable, to further criminal investigations, primarily our CommonwealthWatch Center as well as through our unit attached to the RMV. It is a valuable tool that canhelp investigators identify criminals and, by doing so, seek justice for their victims and takeoffenders off the street before they commit another crime. The State Police unit at the RMV utilizes the technology to investigate suspected driver’slicense and identity fraud. At the Watch Center, meanwhile, State Police analysts have thecapability to use facial recognition to help identify images of crime suspects at the request ofState Police units or other police agencies. Analysts can compare images of unknown suspectsagainst both the RMV database and open-source social media.It is important to note that a facial recognition hit (suggest changing to hit to potential match,not hit) in and of itself is not a positive identification. Rather, it is an investigative lead thatrequires further follow up and vetting by case officers. This is part of the training ourpersonnel receive, and when the Watch Center (part of our Fusion Center) performs a facialrecognition search for an outside agency, the following disclaimer is provided with theresults: The result of a face recognition search is provided by the CFC only as an investigativelead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT.Any possible connection or involvement of any subject to the investigation must be determinedthrough further investigation.As with any other investigative process or technology, use of facial recognition software mayonly be used for legitimate and clearly defined law enforcement purposes, per MSP generalinvestigative policies.

Framingham PD was ableto provide the web addresses for social media profiles of the foursuspects. Through a combination of Facial Recognition and opensource exploitation, State Police Analysts assigned to theCommonwealth Fusion Center were able to positively ID thesuspects, despite several of them utilizing false names and notpossessing Massachusetts Licenses or IDs. All four individuals haveactive warrants from various police departments, including severalfor other armed robberies.Road Rage Incident in Medford• In January, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by theMassachusetts State Police Medford Barracks regarding a road rageincident that occurred at Wellington Circle. The Trooper on sceneprovided cell phone video of the incident taken from inside thevictim’s vehicle, depicting an unknown subject approaching andstriking the vehicle. Facial Recognition conducted on a stillphotograph from the video returned a possible match to aMassachusetts Driver’s License or ID, which was providedwithinminutes to the investigator for follow-up.MSP Crime Gun Unit – Social Media IDs of Gang Members• In February, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contactedby theMassachusetts State Police Crime Gun Unit regarding an attempt toidentify a series of individuals on social media via FacialRecognition. The individuals, believed to be affiliated with a gangrelated crimes, were identified through a combination of FacialRecognition and open source exploitation of publicly availableinformation found on social media. In total, the identities ofapproximately 23 previously unidentified individuals were eitherconfirmed via photograph/tattoo comparison, or tentatively identifiedvia name, date of birth, and geographic profile combined withinformation publicly available on their profiles.Gang Identified for Out of State Agency• In March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted by thethe Criminal Intelligence Center from another eastern state regardingan attempt to identify four members of a street gang believed to haveties to Massachusetts through publicly accessible social mediasources. Through a combination of Facial Recognition and opensource investigation, all four suspects were positively identified andtheir information shared with  State Police in the state from which therequest originated pursuant to an ongoing investigation.MSP H-2 Identified Suspect with Felony Warrant(s)• Also in March, the Commonwealth Fusion Center was contacted bythe Massachusetts State Police Framingham Barracks regarding anattempt to identify person suspected of concealing his true identityfrom police. Facial Recognition on a photograph taken by theinvestigating MSP Trooper on scene returned a possible matchcandidate. Subsequent investigation of the suspect corroborated theidentification of Name/DOB, and also identified an existing felonywarrant under the suspect’s true name, resulting in the suspect’sarrest.

The Massachusetts State Police utilize (might change utilize to mayaccess) facial recognition technology, when applicable, to furthercriminal investigations, primarily our Commonwealth Watch Centeras well as through our unit attached to the RMV. It is a valuable toolthat can help investigators identify criminals and, by doing so, seekjustice for their victims and take offenders off the street before theycommit another crime. The State Police unit at the RMV utilizes the technology toinvestigate suspected driver’s license and identity fraud. At theWatch Center, meanwhile, State Police analysts have the capability touse facial recognition to help identify images of crime suspects at therequest of State Police units or other police agencies. Analysts cancompare images of unknown suspects against both the RMV databaseand open-source social media.It is important to note that a facial recognition hit (suggest changingto hit to potential match, not hit) in and of itself is not a positiveidentification. Rather, it is an investigative lead that requires furtherfollow up and vetting by case officers. This is part of the training ourpersonnel receive, and when the Watch Center (part of our FusionCenter) performs a facial recognition search for an outside agency,the following disclaimer is provided with the results: The result of aface recognition search is provided by the CFC only as aninvestigative lead and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A POSITIVEIDENTIFICATION OF ANY SUBJECT.

All fourindividuals have active warrants fromvarious police departments, includingseveral for other armed robberies.Road Rage Incident in Medford• In January, the Commonwealth FusionCenter was contacted by the MassachusettsState Police Medford Barracks regarding aroad rage incident that occurred atWellington Circle. The Trooper on sceneprovided cell phone video of the incidenttaken from inside the victim’s vehicle,depicting an unknown subject approachingand striking the vehicle. Facial Recognitionconducted on a still photograph from thevideo returned a possible match to aMassachusetts Driver’s License or ID,which was providedwithin minutes to theinvestigator for follow-up.MSP Crime Gun Unit – Social Media IDs ofGang Members• In February, the Commonwealth FusionCenter was contactedby the MassachusettsState Police Crime Gun Unit regarding anattempt to identify a series of individuals onsocial media via Facial Recognition. Theindividuals, believed to be affiliated with agang related crimes, were identified througha combination of Facial Recognition andopen source exploitation of publiclyavailable information found on social media.In total, the identities of approximately 23previously unidentified individuals wereeither confirmed via photograph/tattoocomparison, or tentatively identified vianame, date of birth, and geographic profilecombined with information publiclyavailable on their profiles.Gang Identified for Out of State Agency• In March, the Commonwealth FusionCenter was contacted by the the CriminalIntelligence Center from another easternstate regarding an attempt to identify fourmembers of a street gang believed to haveties to Massachusetts through publiclyaccessible social media sources. Through acombination of Facial Recognition and opensource investigation, all four suspects werepositively identified and their informationshared with  State Police in the state fromwhich the request originated pursuant to anongoing investigation.MSP H-2 Identified Suspect with FelonyWarrant(s)• Also in March, the Commonwealth FusionCenter was contacted by the MassachusettsState Police Framingham Barracks regardingan attempt to identify person suspected ofconcealing his true identity from police.Facial Recognition on a photograph taken bythe investigating MSP Trooper on scenereturned a possible match candidate.Subsequent investigation of the suspectcorroborated the identification ofName/DOB, and also identified an existingfelony warrant under the suspect’s truename, resulting in the suspect’s arrest.

The Scars on the Right Index and the Left middle fingers do not obscure the pattern andtherefore I do not believe these were intentional.  The prints you took were very good and I do not believe that the  AFIS system would havemissed any previous arrests.   In other words if there were a previous arrest under this nameor any other it would have located it.  I have also searched his individual fingers as Latent Prints, which is how we find the trueidentity of individuals with good mutilations and I have not located any other fingerprint fileson this individual in Mass. I am still waiting on the results of searches in  the FBI NGI database. Should be back this evening. Will advise when they have come back.  I have also done name searches and no other files were located.  Brian O'HaraMass State Police Identification Section59 Horse Pond Rd.Sudbury, ma 01776  Cell508-358-3114 Work "

Micciche, I have examined the prints of  ,   dob:   MA  .  Although he does have two (2) fingers with scars. The rest of the fingers are not scarred or cutat all. The Scars on the Right Index and the Left middle fingers do not obscure the pattern andtherefore I do not believe these were intentional.  The prints you took were very good and I do not believe that the  AFIS system would havemissed any previous arrests.   In other words if there were a previous arrest under this nameor any other it would have located it.  I have also searched his individual fingers as Latent Prints, which is how we find the trueidentity of individuals with good mutilations and I have not located any other fingerprint fileson this individual in Mass. I am still waiting on the results of searches in  the FBI NGI database. Should be back this evening. Will advise when they have come back.  I have also done name searches and no other files were located.  Brian O'HaraMass State Police Identification Section59 Horse Pond Rd.Sudbury, ma 01776  Cell508-358-3114 Work "

While reviewing some of the documents I received back from subpoenas, I discovered that heobtained a State of Mass. Driver’s license using the identity of victim from NY.  The Mass dl # iss  in the name of   who is a disabled male who resides in NY.  I am passingthis info along in case Mr.   has committed other fraud related offenses in your state.  Mr. uses abandoned or for sale property addresses to commit his frauds.  He also utilizes females toopen accounts using fake identification and  letters of incorporation that are legit on the face, butthe businesses are fictitious and the president is the fake id the female produced at the bank.  Mr. has a lengthy rap sheet involving weapons offenses and fraud related crimes.  I just want toforward this because he is prolific in the frauds he commits.
